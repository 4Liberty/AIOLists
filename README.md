# AIOLists Stremio Addon

A Stremio addon to manage all your lists in one place, with powerful import, customization, and integration features.

#âœ¨ Features
- **Unified List Management:** Import and manage lists from various sources in one place.
- **MDBList & Trakt URL Imports:** Directly import lists by pasting URLs from MDBList.com and Trakt.tv.
- **Trakt Integration:** Connect your Trakt account to access personal lists, watchlist, recommendations, trending, and popular content.
- **External Addon Importing:** Import lists from other Stremio addons, should support most popular ones.
- **Sorting:** If the sorting option exists it's there.
- **List Customization:**
    - **Reorder:** Drag and drop to arrange lists as you like.
    - **Rename:** Give custom names to any list for better organization.
    - **Merge/Split:** If a list contains both movies and series you can merge it into a single Stremio row so it doesn't take up more space than it needs to.
- **Instant Watchlist Updates:** Fetches watchlist content on load.
- **RPDB Support:** Optional RatingPosterDB (RPDB) integration for enhanced poster images across all your lists (requires your own RPDB API key).
- **Configurable Genre Filtering:** If you add too many list you might hit the 8kb manifest size limit. By disabling genre filtering the manifest size should half so you can have more lists.
- **Discovery Lists:** Randomly selected MDBList from a set list of users, a new random list is delivered everytime you refresh the catalog.
- **Share Your Setup:** Generate a shareable hash of your AIOLists configuration (list order, names, imported addons) to share with others.

#### Deploying on Railway, Render, Fly.io, etc.

Most modern PaaS providers that support Docker can deploy AIOLists.
-   **Railway**: Connect your GitHub repository and let Railway build from the `Dockerfile`. Set the `PORT` environment variable if needed (Railway usually injects it).
-   **Render**: Create a new "Web Service", connect your repository, and choose Docker as the environment. Render will build and deploy from the `Dockerfile`. Set the `PORT` environment variable.
-   **Fly.io**: Use the `flyctl` CLI to launch a new app. It can often detect and use your `Dockerfile`.

### Deploy with Docker

**Steps:**

1.  **Clone your fork (or the original repository):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/AIOLists.git # Replace YOUR_USERNAME if you forked
    cd AIOLists
    ```

2.  **Build the Docker image:**
    ```bash
    docker build -t aiolists-addon .
    ```

3.  **Run the container:**
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 7000:7000 -e NODE_ENV=production --restart unless-stopped aiolists-addon
    ```
    Your addon will be available at `http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:7000`. You can then access the configuration panel at `http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:7000/configure`.

### Deploy on Your Own Node.js Server

You can also run the addon directly with Node.js if you prefer not to use Docker.

1.  **Clone your fork:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/AIOLists.git
    cd AIOLists
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install --production
    ```
3.  **Start the server:**
    ```bash
    npm run prod
    ```
    The server will start on port 7000 by default. Access `/configure`.
